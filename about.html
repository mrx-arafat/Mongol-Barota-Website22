        <h4>A quick Recap: Our Journey</h4>
        <p>
          Team Mongol Barota was born in 2013, with a vision of reaching higher than ever. Since its inception, this
          ambitious
          little team had only one objective: To present our institute, as well as our country on a global platform with
          pride.
          Since then, the team has begun designing and fabricating futuristic Mars rovers in order to challenge other
          teams
          across the globe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, the team has grown and evolved into something marvelous. As future engineers, we prioritise
          collaboration, learning, and collective effort all throughout any project, to turn our initial vision into
          concrete reality. Now we go forward with the motto, "Nothing is constant, other than change", constantly
          evolving,
          to keep up with the challenges we face.

        <h4>URC 2021</h4>
        <p>
          After a long hiatus, Team Mongol Barota has risen from its ashes, with a new rover, aptly named "PHOENIX". The
          team, now stronger
          than ever, participated in the University Rover Challenge of 2021, and won the championship with flying
          colors. This was a first in the history
          of our team, the institute, as well as our country, Bangladesh.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key to this success was the efficient collaboration among the CSE and ME departments, making the team
          stronger than ever.

        <h4>ERC 2016</h4>
        <p>
          Team Mongol Barota's first attempt at the European Rover Challenge was on 2016. The team had tried their best,
          with high ambition and will to reach the top.
          However, the team had not been successful in that attempt, resulting in our team entering a period of hiatus
          for the next few years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part of the journey is the hardship and the loss, something that the team felt profoundly after the challenge
          came to an end.

        <h4>URC 2015</h4>
        <p>
          The team, after its unexpected success in 2014, continued with its journey in URC 2015. With a more organized
          team and better design,
          the performance of the team had greatly improved, reflected in the attainment of the global 9th place.

        <h4>URC 2014</h4>
        <p>
          Starting with limited resources and a small team, the Team Mongol Barota was forged in 2013 with a singular
          vision of
          representing the institute, as well as Bangladesh, on a global platform with pride. Working on its first rover
          for a full year,
          the team participated in the University Rover Challenge (URC) of 2014, marking the first ever time any team
          from Bangladesh
          entered this prestigious global challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even in this first attempt, the team has earned a respectable 12th position globally, marking history and
          paving the way
          for the journey that laid ahead.
